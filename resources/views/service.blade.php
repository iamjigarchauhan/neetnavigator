          <li>ATMIA NEET College Predictor is an online tool or platform that aims to help students predict and identify the colleges they might be eligible for based on their NEET scores.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>ATMIA NEET College Predictor considers various factors such as the student's NEET score, category (General, OBC, SC/ST, etc.), state of residence, and sometimes other preferences like language, location, and reservation criteria.

        <p>It's important to note that the NEET College Predictor provides an estimate or prediction based on historical data and trends. The actual admission results may vary depending on several factors, including the number of applicants, the difficulty level of the exam, and changes in admission criteria, but ATMIA will help you get your MBBS seat in INDIAN Medical colleges by proper guidance form your form filling to the choice filling for the medical colleges.</p>
